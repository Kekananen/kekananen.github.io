I am thrilled to announce that I was recently awarded an [NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503622&org=NSF)! I applied to several competitive fellowship programs and received generally positive feedback, but this was the first program that decided to extend an award to me for my research. This fellowship will provide three years of salary support and modest research funding to pursue a project focused on the evolutionary genomics of convergent limb reduction in the Australian lizard genus *Lerista*. I will pursue this work under the guidance of [Scott Edwards](https://edwards.oeb.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University and I am excited to immerse myself in a new, stimulating research environment at the [Museum of Comparative Zoology](https://mcz.harvard.edu/). I also get to spend significant amounts of time in Adelaide, Australia as part of my project working with collaborators [Steve Donnellan](http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/about/staff/prof-steve-donnellan), [Mark Hutchinson](http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/about/staff/dr-mark-hutchinson), and [Mike Lee](http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/about/staff/dr-mike-lee), which will be a lot of fun. I have also arranged to learn cutting-edge micro-CT scanning techniques with [Johannes MÃ¼ller](https://www.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/en/taxonomy/term/234/johannes.mueller) in Berlin. Special thanks, also, to my doctoral advisor [Todd Castoe](http://www.snakegenomics.org/CastoeLab/Castoe_Lab_Home.html), whose mentorship was instrumental in my scientific and career development!
