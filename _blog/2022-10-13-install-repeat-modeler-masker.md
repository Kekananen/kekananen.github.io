## Introduction
RepeatModeler and RepeatMasker are sister software packages for *de novo* identification of repeats in genomes and annotation / masking of repeats based on an existing library, respectively. These programs have been widely used for over a decade and are vital tools for genome annotation, though newer repeat pipelines are also emerging. Despite the popularity of these programs, they can often be difficult to use primarily because of the installation overhead. Because installation is a bottleneck and I often receive request for guidance in installing RepeatModeler / RepeatMasker, I decided to make a tutorial on installing both pieces of software. I have been using both for about 10 years and in thattime, the installation process has only changed in minor ways, so I'm confident this guide will be helpful well into the future, though there may be some subtle differences with future versions of the software.
