After an arduous 24-hour journey from Dallas to Adelaide, I finally arrived in Australia. I do not normally do selfie's, but I took a quick one to document my touchdown in a new country and continent. Just excuse the poor image quality, as I'm still repping my iPhone 4.

I'm excited to be in a new place and to start putting resources and data in place for my postdoctoral research! My major goals for the three months I will be here are to establish genomic resources (tissues, sequencing, etc.) for my study system: *Lerista* lizards. I will be based in Adelaide, but hope to explore some more of the country as well. Stay tuned for future updates about the trip and research progress!
