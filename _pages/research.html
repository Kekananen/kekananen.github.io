    title: "Genomics of Adaptation"
    excerpt: 'Since beginning as a researcher I have been interested in understanding the process of adaptation, particularly at the level of genetics. During my Ph.D., I used combinations of genomic data to examine rapid adaptation to novel ecological conditions in invasive Florida Burmese pythons ([Card *et al.*, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.14885)) and the repeated evolution of island dwarf phenotypes in Central American boa constrictors (Card *et al.*, In Prep). My postdoctoral research is focused on understanding interspecies differences in limb morphology in the Australian skink genus *Lerista*, where species vary from full pentadactyl limbs to total limblessness with several intermediate forms. As part of this project, I am combining morphological and whole-genome data for dozens of species with functional genomic data collected from embryos to provide an integrated look into the genetic and molecular underpinnings of limb morphology.'
