    alt: "Adaptive limb loss in Australian skinks"
    title: "Genomics of Adaptation"
    excerpt: 'Since beginning as a researcher, I have been interested in understanding the process of adaptation, particularly at the level of genetics. During my Ph.D., I used combinations of genomic data to examine rapid adaptation to novel ecological conditions in invasive Florida Burmese pythons ([Card *et al.*, 2018, *Molecular Ecology*](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.14885)) and the repeated evolution of island dwarf phenotypes in Central American boa constrictors ([Card *et al.*, 2019, *Genome Biology & Evolution*](https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evz226)). My postdoctoral research is focused on understanding interspecies differences in limb morphology in the Australian skink genus *Lerista*, where species vary from full pentadactyl limbs to total limblessness with several intermediate forms. As part of this project, I am combining morphological and whole-genome data for dozens of species with functional genomic data collected from embryos to provide an integrated look into the genetic and molecular underpinnings of limb morphology.'

    alt: "Convergent island dwarfism in boas"
    title: "Convergent Evolution"
    excerpt: 'Convergent evolution provides some of the strongest evidence for the process of evolution by natural selection. My research has focused on adding to the small, but growing, body of literature describing systems where phenotypic convergence is mediated by molecular convergence. My doctoral research examined repeated evolution of island dwarf phenotypes in Central American boa constrictors ([Card *et al.*, 2016. *MPE*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2016.05.034); [Card *et al.*, 2019, *Genome Biology & Evolution*](https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evz226)). My current research focusing on the evolution of reduced limb morphologies in Australian *Lerista* also provides the opportunity to examine shallow-scale convergence, as limb morphotypes have evolved independently in two *Lerista* clades.'

    alt: "Squamate reptile repeat landscapes"
    title: "Genome Structure, Function, & Evolution"
    excerpt: 'The structure of genomes, including overall size, karyotype, repetitive content, and more, is an important driver of organism phenotype and evolves in interesting ways. As a researcher, I have contributed to producing several genomic resources for squamate reptiles, including the Burmese python - the first snake genome ([Castoe *et al.*, 2013, *PNAS*](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1314475110)), a genome for the garter snake - an important model organism in ecology ([Perry/Card *et al.*, 2018, *Genome Biology & Evolution*](https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evy157)), and the prairie rattlesnake - the first chromosome-scale assembly for any squamate ([Schield *et al.*, 2019, *Genome Research*](https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.240952.118)). I have also contributed to work seeking to understand lineage-specific patterns of repetitive content, including microsatellite content across vertebrates ([Adams *et al.*, 2016, *Genome*](https://doi.org/10.1139/gen-2015-0124)) and repetitive landscapes across squamate reptiles ([Pasquesi *et al.*, 2018, *Nature Communication*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-05279-1)).'
