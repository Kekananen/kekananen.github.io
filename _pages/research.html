    title: "Genomics of Adaptation"
    excerpt: 'Since beginning as a researcher, I have been interested in understanding the process of adaptation, particularly at the level of genetics. During my Ph.D., I used combinations of genomic data to examine rapid adaptation to novel ecological conditions in invasive Florida Burmese pythons ([Card *et al.*, 2018, *Molecular Ecology*](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.14885)) and the repeated evolution of island dwarf phenotypes in Central American boa constrictors (Card *et al.*, In Prep). My postdoctoral research is focused on understanding interspecies differences in limb morphology in the Australian skink genus *Lerista*, where species vary from full pentadactyl limbs to total limblessness with several intermediate forms. As part of this project, I am combining morphological and whole-genome data for dozens of species with functional genomic data collected from embryos to provide an integrated look into the genetic and molecular underpinnings of limb morphology.'

    title: "Genome Structure, Function, & Evolution"
    excerpt: 'The structure of genomes, including overall size, karyotype, repetitive content, and more, is an important driver of organism phenotype and evolves in interest ways. As a researcher, I have contributed to producing several genomic resources for squamate reptiles, including the Burmese python - the first snake genome ([Castoe *et al.*, 2013, *PNAS*](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1314475110)), a genome for the garter snake - an important model organism in ecology ([Perry/Card *et al.*, 2018, *Genome Biology & Evolution*](https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evy157)), and the prairie rattlesnake - the first chromosome-scale assembly for any squamate (Schield *et al.*, In Review). I have also contributed to work seeking to understand lineage-specific patterns of repetitive content, including microsatellite content across vertebrates ([Adams *et al.*, 2016, *Genome*](https://doi.org/10.1139/gen-2015-0124)) and repetitive landscapes across squamate reptiles ([Pasquesi *et al.*, 2018, *Nature Communication*)[https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-05279-1]).'
