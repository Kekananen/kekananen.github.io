We used low-coverage (∼3.5–5.5x) Illumina paired-end sequencing to assemble draft genomes of two bird species (the Gunnison Sage-Grouse, Centrocercus minimus, and the Clark's Nutcracker, Nucifraga columbiana). We used these data to estimate de novo genome assemblies and reference-guided assemblies, and compared the information content and completeness of these assemblies by comparing CEGMA gene set representation, repeat element content, simple sequence repeat content, and GC isochore structure among assemblies.

Identification of the molecular basis of these traits can provide novel understanding for vertebrate biology and medicine. Here, we study snake biology using the genome sequence of the Burmese python (Python molurus bivittatus), a model of extreme physiological and metabolic adaptation. We compare the python and king cobra genomes along with genomic samples from other snakes and perform transcriptome analysis to gain insights into the extreme phenotypes of the python. We discovered rapid and massive transcriptional responses in multiple organ systems that occur on feeding and coordinate major changes in organ size and function. Intriguingly, the homologs of these genes in humans are associated with metabolism, development, and pathology. We also found that many snake metabolic genes have undergone positive selection, which together with the rapid evolution of mitochondrial proteins, provides evidence for extensive adaptive redesign of snake metabolic pathways. Additional evidence for molecular adaptation and gene family expansions and contractions is associated with major physiological and phenotypic adaptations in snakes; genes involved are related to cell cycle, development, lungs, eyes, heart, intestine, and skeletal structure, including GRB2-associated binding protein 1, SSH, WNT16, and bone morphogenetic protein 7. Finally, changes in repetitive DNA content, guanine-cytosine isochore structure, and nucleotide substitution rates indicate major shifts in the structure and evolution of snake genomes compared with other amniotes. Phenotypic and physiological novelty in snakes seems to be driven by system-wide coordination of protein adaptation, gene expression, and changes in the structure of the genome.","2013-12-17","2018-01-19 20:03:39","2018-01-22 14:58:43","2018-01-19 20:03:39","20645-20650","","51","110","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","www.pnas.org","","00137  PMID: 24297902","","/Users/darencard/Cloud_Drives/Box_Sync/Zotero_library/CastoeTC_2013_PNAS_The_Burmese_python_genome_reveals_the_molecular_basis_for_extreme_adaptation_in_snakes.pdf; ; /Users/darencard/Zotero/storage/P2ZNRGJJ/20645.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24297902","","comparative genomics; physiological remodeling; systems biology; transcriptomics; transposable elements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We took a novel approach to studying snake venom evolution by leveraging the complete genome of the Burmese python, including information from tissue-specific patterns of gene expression. We identified the orthologs of snake venom genes in the python genome, and conducted detailed analysis of gene expression of these venom homologs to identify patterns that differ between snake venom gene families and all other genes. We found that venom gene homologs in the python are expressed in many different tissues outside of oral glands, which illustrates the pitfalls of using transcriptomic data alone to define “venom toxins.” We hypothesize that the python may represent an ancestral state prior to major venom development, which is supported by our finding that the expansion of venom gene families is largely restricted to highly venomous caenophidian snakes. Therefore, the python provides insight into biases in which genes were recruited for snake venom systems. Python venom homologs are generally expressed at lower levels, have higher variance among tissues, and are expressed in fewer organs compared with all other python genes. We propose a model for the evolution of snake venoms in which venom genes are recruited preferentially from genes with particular expression profile characteristics, which facilitate a nearly neutral transition toward specialized venom system expression.","2015-01-01","2018-01-21 00:46:44","2018-01-22 03:18:03","2018-01-21 00:46:44","173-183","","1","32","","Mol Biol Evol","","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","academic.oup.com","","00000","","/Users/darencard/Cloud_Drives/Box_Sync/Zotero_library/Reyes-VelascoJR_2015_Mol_Biol_Evol_Expression_of_Venom_Gene_Homologs_in_Diverse_Python_Tissues_Suggests_a_New_Model_for_the_Evolution_of_Snake_Venom.pdf; /Users/darencard/Zotero/storage/WQ2SDTWY/2925580.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diverse methods have been developed to study epigenetic states, including bisulphite sequencing and AFLP-based approaches. However, existing methods are sometimes difficult to apply to non-traditional model organisms that lack genomic resources (bisulphite sequencing), and can fail to be economical and readily scalable to diverse research questions because of reliance on traditional Sanger sequencing (AFLP approaches). * Here we develop a reduced-representation library-based approach that is scalable and economical to quantitatively compare patterns of genomewide methylation. This approach shares substantial similarity to the now widely used double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing-based method (ddRADseq), except that it utilizes a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme. This method therefore identifies changes in the genomic methylation state of cytosine (to 5-methylcytosine; 5mC) by sampling loci (via next-generation sequencing) that are not methylated within a sample. We test this method to identify shifts in the epigenome of clonal water fleas (Daphnia ambigua) in response to exposure to fish predator cues, which are known to induce transgenerational changes in life-history traits. * We found evidence for differential transgenerational responses (inferred via significant shifts in the methylation state of sampled loci) to predator cues among our treatment groups and remarkably consistent responses within treatment groups. Our results demonstrate that this method is capable of producing highly repeatable results even without the use of a reference genome. * Applications of this general method are broad and diverse and include the analysis of epigenetic shifts in both experimental and natural study systems.","2016-01-01","2018-01-23 00:55:09","2018-01-23 00:55:09","2018-01-23 00:55:09","60-69","","1","7","","Methods Ecol Evol","EpiRADseq","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/darencard/Cloud_Drives/Box_Sync/Zotero_library/SchieldDS_2016_Methods_Ecol_Evol_EpiRADseq_-_scalable_analysis_of_genomewide_patterns_of_methylation_using_next-generation_sequencing.pdf; /Users/darencard/Zotero/storage/PKHU98C5/abstract.html","","","epigenetics; CpG methylation; Daphnia; high-throughput methylation measurement; restriction-site associated DNA sequencing; transgenerational shift","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite this substantial diversity, the systematics of the genus Boa has received little attention until very recently. In this study we examined the genetic structure and phylogenetic relationships of Boa populations using mitochondrial sequences and genome-wide SNP data obtained from RADseq. We analyzed these data at multiple geographic scales using a combination of phylogenetic inference (including coalescent-based species delimitation) and population genetic analyses. We identified extensive population structure across the range of the genus Boa and multiple lines of evidence for three widely-distributed clades roughly corresponding with the three primary land masses of the Western Hemisphere.

Accordingly, snakes have been a well-studied model for sex chromosome evolution in animals [1, 4]. A review of the literature, however, reveals no compelling support that boas and pythons possess ZW sex chromosomes [2, 5]. Furthermore, phylogenetic patterns of facultative parthenogenesis in snakes and a sex-linked color mutation in the ball python (Python regius) are best explained by boas and pythons possessing an XY sex chromosome system [6, 7]. Here we demonstrate that a boa (Boa imperator) and python (Python bivittatus) indeed possess XY sex chromosomes, based on the discovery of male-specific genetic markers in both species. We use these markers, along with transcriptomic and genomic data, to identify distinct sex chromosomes in boas and pythons, demonstrating that XY systems evolved independently in each lineage. This discovery highlights the dynamic evolution of vertebrate sex chromosomes and further enhances the value of snakes as a model for studying sex chromosome evolution.","2017-07-24","2018-01-23 00:56:58","2018-01-23 00:56:58","2018-01-23 00:56:58","2148-2153.e4","","14","27","","Current Biology","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/darencard/Cloud_Drives/Box_Sync/Zotero_library/GambleTG_2017_Current_Biology_The_Discovery_of_XY_Sex_Chromosomes_in_a_Boa_and_Python.pdf; /Users/darencard/Zotero/storage/46PJXE9V/S096098221730711X.html","","","Squamata; snake; genome; evolution; reptile; sex chromosome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analyzed the Burmese python intestine across a time series, before, during, and after feeding to understand the patterns and timing of changes in gene expression and their relationship to changes in intestinal form and function upon feeding. Our results indicate that >2,000 genes show significant changes in expression in the small intestine following feeding, including genes involved in intestinal morphology and function (e.g., hydrolases, microvillus proteins, trafficking and transport proteins), as well as genes involved in cell division and apoptosis. Extensive changes in gene expression occur surprisingly rapidly, within the first 6 h of feeding, coincide with changes in intestinal morphology, and effectively return to prefeeding levels within 10 days. Collectively, our results provide an unprecedented portrait of parallel changes in gene expression and intestinal morphology and physiology on a scale that is extreme both in the magnitude of changes, as well as in the incredibly short time frame of these changes, with up- and downregulation of expression and function occurring in the span of 10 days.

We evaluate these methods on (i) simulated landscape genetic data analysed for differentiation outliers and genetic-environment associations and (ii) empirical genomic data analysed for selective sweeps within dog breeds for loci known to be selected for during domestication. We also introduce and evaluate how robust statistical algorithms can be used for parameter estimation in statistical genomics. * On the simulated data, many of the composite measures performed well and had decreased variation in outcomes across many sampling designs. On the empirical dataset, methods based on combining P-values generally performed better with clearer signals of selection, higher significance of the signal, and in closer proximity to the known selected locus.

Overall, a composite statistic that measured a robust multivariate distance from rank-based P-values performed the best. * We found that composite measures of selection could improve the signal of selection in many cases, but they were not a panacea and their power is limited by the power of the univariate statistics they summarize.

The rapid accumulation of genomic information from squamate reptiles is generating important new context and insights into the biology, the regulation and diversity of venom toxins, and the evolutionary processes that have generated this diversity. It is an exciting time as we discover what the unique aspects of the squamate genome can tell us about the molecular basis of such interesting and diverse phenotypes and explain how the extreme adaptations of squamate biology arose. This chapter reviews what is known about major patterns and evolutionary trends in squamate genomes and discusses how some of these features may relate to the evolution and development of unique features of squamate biology and physiology on the whole, including the evolution and regulation of venom toxins. It also discusses current challenges and obstacles in understanding squamate genome size, diversity, and evolution, and specific issues related to assembling and studying regions of squamate genomes that contain the genes and regulatory regions for venom toxins. Evidence is presented for a relatively constant genome size across squamates even though there have been major shifts in genomic structure and evolutionary processes. Some genomic structural features seem relatively unique to squamates and may have played roles in the evolution of venom toxins.","2014","2018-01-23 01:00:22","2018-01-23 01:13:25","2018-01-23 01:00:22","1-18","","","","","","","","","","","Springer, Dordrecht","","en","All rights reserved","","","","link-springer-com.ezproxy.uta.edu","","DOI: 10.1007/978-94-007-6649-5_34-2","","/Users/darencard/Cloud_Drives/Box_Sync/Zotero_library/ShaneyKS_2014_Toxinology_Squamate_Reptile_Genomics_and_Evolution.pdf; /Users/darencard/Zotero/storage/VK44UHC4/10.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has long been assumed that shifts in gene expression are tightly linked to observed trait responses at the phenotypic level. Yet, the manner in which organisms couple within- and TGP at the molecular level is unclear. Here we tested the influence of fish predator chemical cues on patterns of gene expression within- and across generations using a clone of Daphnia ambigua that is known to exhibit strong TGP but weak within-generation plasticity. Daphnia were reared in the presence of predator cues in generation 1, and shifts in gene expression were tracked across two additional asexual experimental generations that lacked exposure to predator cues. Initial exposure to predator cues in generation 1 was linked to ~50 responsive genes, but such shifts were 3–4× larger in later generations. Differentially expressed genes included those involved in reproduction, exoskeleton structure and digestion; major shifts in expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins were also identified. Furthermore, shifts within the first-generation and transgenerational shifts in gene expression were largely distinct in terms of the genes that were differentially expressed. Such results argue that the gene expression programmes involved in within- vs. transgeneration plasticity are fundamentally different. Our study provides new key insights into the plasticity of gene expression and how it relates to phenotypic plasticity in nature.","2017-10-01","2018-01-23 01:03:57","2018-01-23 01:03:57","2018-01-23 01:03:57","5003-5015","","19","26","","Mol Ecol","","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/darencard/Cloud_Drives/Box_Sync/Zotero_library/HalesNH_2017_Mol_Ecol_Contrasting_gene_expression_programs_correspond_with_predator-induced_phenotypic_plasticity_within_and_across_generations_in_Daphnia.pdf; /Users/darencard/Zotero/storage/46YDANTR/abstract.html","","","transcriptomics; epigenetics; ecoresponsive; transgenerational plasticity; water fleas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we use a paternal half-sibling breeding design in captive brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) to show that the development of sexual size dimorphism is mirrored by the ontogenetic breakdown of rmf for body size and growth rate. Using transcriptome data from the liver (which integrates growth and metabolism), we show that sex-biased gene expression also increases dramatically between ontogenetic stages bracketing this breakdown of rmf. Ontogenetic increases in sex-biased expression are particularly evident for genes involved in growth, metabolism, and cell proliferation, suggesting that they contribute to both the development of sexual dimorphism and the breakdown of rmf. Mechanistically, we show that treatment of females with testosterone stimulates the expression of male-biased genes while inhibiting the expression of female-biased genes, thereby inducing male-like phenotypes at both organismal and transcriptomic levels. Collectively, our results suggest that sex-specific modifiers such as testosterone can orchestrate sex-biased gene expression to facilitate the phenotypic development of sexual dimorphism while simultaneously reducing genetic correlations that would otherwise constrain the independent evolution of the sexes.","2017-01-25","2018-01-23 01:04:14","2018-01-23 01:04:14","2018-01-23 01:04:14","315-332","","3","189","","The American Naturalist","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","","","","/Users/darencard/Cloud_Drives/Box_Sync/Zotero_library/CoxRC_2017_The_American_Naturalist_Hormonally_Mediated_Increases_in_Sex-Biased_Gene_Expression_Accompany_the_Breakdown_of_Between-Sex_Genetic_Correlations_in_a_Sexually_Dimorphic_Lizard.pdf; /Users/darencard/Zotero/storage/M4EWC5IB/690105.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we studied the genomic landscape of divergence and introgression following secondary contact between lineages of the Western Diamondback Rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) to determine whether genomic regions under selection in allopatry also contribute to reproductive isolation during introgression. We used thousands of nuclear loci to study genomic differentiation between two lineages that have experienced recent secondary contact following isolation, and incorporated sampling from a zone of secondary contact to identify loci that are resistant to gene flow in hybrids. Comparisons of patterns of divergence and introgression revealed a positive relationship between allelic differentiation and resistance to introgression across the genome, and greater-than-expected overlap between genes linked to lineage-specific divergence and loci that resist introgression. Genes linked to putatively selected markers were related to prominent aspects of rattlesnake biology that differ between populations of Western Diamondback rattlesnakes (i.e., venom and reproductive phenotypes). We also found evidence for selection against introgression of genes that may contribute to cytonuclear incompatibility, consistent with previously observed biased patterns of nuclear and mitochondrial alleles suggestive of partial reproductive isolation due to cytonuclear incompatibilities. Our results provide a genome-scale perspective on the relationships between divergence and introgression in secondary contact that is relevant for understanding the roles of selection in maintaining partial isolation of lineages, causing admixing lineages to not completely homogenize.","2017-06-01","2018-01-23 01:09:34","2018-01-23 01:09:34","2018-01-23 01:09:34","3951-3966","","11","7","","Ecol Evol","","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/darencard/Cloud_Drives/Box_Sync/Zotero_library/SchieldDS_2017_Ecol_Evol_Insight_into_the_roles_of_selection_in_speciation_from_genomic_patterns_of_divergence_and_introgression_in_secondary_contact_in_venomous_rattlesnakes.pdf; /Users/darencard/Zotero/storage/4BBUQHA3/abstract.html","","","gene flow; RADseq; adaptation; divergence; genomic clines; hybridization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One approach to accomplish this is targeted capture (hybrid enrichment). While these methods are well established for genome resequencing projects, cross-species capture strategies are still being developed and generally focus on the capture of conserved regions, rather than complete coding regions from specific genes of interest. The resulting data is thus useful for phylogenetic studies, but the wealth of comparative data that could be used for evolutionary and functional studies is lost. Here, we design and implement a targeted capture method that enables recovery of complete coding regions across broad taxonomic scales. Capture probes were designed from multiple reference species and extensively tiled in order to facilitate cross-species capture. Using novel bioinformatics pipelines we were able to recover nearly all of the targeted genes with high completeness from species that were up to 200 myr divergent. Increased probe diversity and tiling for a subset of genes had a large positive effect on both recovery and completeness. The resulting data produced an accurate species tree, but importantly this same data can also be applied to studies of molecular evolution and function that will allow researchers to ask larger questions in broader phylogenetic contexts. Our method demonstrates the utility of cross-species approaches for the capture of full length coding sequences, and will substantially improve the ability for researchers to conduct large-scale comparative studies of molecular evolution and function.","2017-02-01","2018-01-23 01:09:51","2018-01-23 01:09:51","2018-01-23 01:09:51","398-414","","2","9","","Genome Biol Evol","","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","academic-oup-com.ezproxy.uta.edu","","","","/Users/darencard/Cloud_Drives/Box_Sync/Zotero_library/SchottRS_2017_Genome_Biol_Evol_Targeted_Capture_of_Complete_Coding_Regions_across_Divergent_Species.pdf; /Users/darencard/Zotero/storage/5RL9R4BV/2963137.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the past several decades, transmission control strategies implemented in China have reduced the prevalence and morbidity of Schistosoma japonicum in many areas. Infections still persist, however, and it is therefore of great interest to determine the sources of recurring infections. Genetic analysis is a promising means to achieve this. Towards this aim, we conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility of using high-throughput sequencing to assess the geographic distribution of schistosome genetic variants. Because DNA yields from miracidia, the most easily accessible life stage, are insufficient for high throughput sequencing, we first employed whole genome amplification to obtain sufficient quantities of DNA. We then employed a technique that reproducibly sequences the same fraction of a genome across numerous samples. We successfully sequenced 6-year old S. japonicum samples from Sichuan Province, China, easily and economically identifying tens of thousands of variable loci, a sufficient number to discriminate fine-scale population structure. Further population sampling will help answer important questions concerning the persistence of infections, the sources of new infections, and whether parasite populations have undergone incipient evolution of drug resistance.","2017-01-20","2018-01-23 01:10:19","2018-01-23 01:10:19","2018-01-23 01:10:19","e0005292","","1","11","","PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases","","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/darencard/Cloud_Drives/Box_Sync/Zotero_library/ShorttJS_2017_PLOS_Neglected_Tropical_Diseases_Whole_Genome_Amplification_and_Reduced-Representation_Genome_Sequencing_of_Schistosoma_japonicum_Miracidia.pdf; /Users/darencard/Zotero/storage/HUCK5Y4G/article.html","","","Genomic libraries; Microsatellite loci; Genetic loci; Invertebrate genomics; Genomics; Polymerase chain reaction; Schistosoma; Schistosoma japonicum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used mitochondrial DNA and thousands of nuclear loci from double-digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing to infer population genetic structure throughout the range of C. scutulatus, and to evaluate divergence times and gene flow between populations. We find strong support for several divergent mitochondrial and nuclear clades of C. scutulatus, including splits coincident with two major phylogeographic barriers: the Continental Divide and the elevational increase associated with the Central Mexican Plateau. We apply Bayesian clustering, phylogenetic inference, and coalescent-based species delimitation to our nuclear genetic data to test hypotheses of population structure. We also performed demographic analyses to test hypotheses relating to population divergence and gene flow. Collectively, our results support the existence of four distinct lineages within C. scutulatus, and genetically defined populations do not correspond with currently recognized subspecies ranges.

While research has shown that phenotypic evolution can occur rapidly in nature, few examples exist of genomewide adaptation on short ?ecological? timescales. Burmese pythons (Python molurus bivittatus) have become a successful and impactful invasive species in Florida over the last 30 years despite major freeze events that caused high python mortality. We sampled Florida Burmese pythons before and after a major freeze event in 2010 and found evidence for directional selection in genomic regions enriched for genes associated with thermosensation, behaviour and physiology. Several of these genes are linked to regenerative organ growth, an adaptive response that modulates organ size and function with feeding and fasting in pythons. Independent histological and functional genomic data sets provide additional layers of support for a contemporary shift in invasive Burmese python physiology. In the Florida population, a shift towards maintaining an active digestive system may be driven by the fitness benefits of maintaining higher metabolic rates and body temperature during freeze events. Our results suggest that a synergistic interaction between ecological and climatic selection pressures has driven adaptation in Florida Burmese pythons, demonstrating the often-overlooked potential of rapid adaptation to influence the success of invasive species.","2018-09-30","2018-12-02 09:27:06","2019-08-04 21:49:30","2018-12-02 09:27:06","4744-4757","","23","27","","Molecular Ecology","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.uta.edu (Atypon)","","","","/Users/darencard/Cloud_Drives/Box_Sync/Zotero_library/CardDC_2018_Molecular_Ecology_Novel_ecological_and_climatic_conditions_drive_rapid_adaptation_in_invasive_Florida_Burmese_pythons.pdf; /Users/darencard/Zotero/storage/UNH9GA2V/mec.html","","","natural selection; genomic scans; invasive species; regenerative organ growth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Campbell-Staton et al. () address these broad questions by investigating cold tolerance adaptation in the green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis) across a latitudinal transect. By integrating physiological data, gene expression data and acclimation experiments, the authors disentangle the mechanisms underlying cold adaptation. They first establish that cold tolerance adaptation in Anolis lizards follows the predictions of the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance hypothesis, which states that organisms are limited by temperature thresholds at which oxygen supply cannot meet demand. They then explore the drivers of cold tolerance at a finer scale, finding evidence that northern populations are adapted to cooler thermal regimes and that both phenotypic plasticity and heritable genetic variation contribute to cold tolerance. The integration of physiological and gene expression data further highlights the varied mechanisms that drive cold tolerance adaptation in Anolis lizards, including both supply-side and demand-side adaptations that improve oxygen economy. Altogether, their work provides new insight into the physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying adaptation to new climatic niches and demonstrates that cold tolerance in northern lizard populations is achieved through the synergy of physiological plasticity and local genetic adaptation for thermal performance.","2018-05-01","2018-12-02 09:28:19","2018-12-02 09:28:19","2018-12-02 09:28:19","2173-2175","","9","27","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/darencard/Cloud_Drives/Box_Sync/Zotero_library/CardDC_2018_Molecular_Ecology_Plasticity_and_local_adaptation_explain_lizard_cold_tolerance.pdf; /Users/darencard/Zotero/storage/A6JNZEUU/mec.html","","","transcriptomics; local adaptation; physiology; thermal tolerance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Comparative analyses with other amniotes provide new insight into the origins, structure, and function of reptile microchromosomes, which we demonstrate have markedly different structure and function compared to macrochromosomes. Snake microchromosomes are also enriched for venom genes, which we show have evolved through multiple tandem duplication events in multiple gene families. By overlaying chromatin structure information and gene expression data, we find evidence for venom gene-specific chromatin contact domains and identify how chromatin structure guides precise expression of multiple venom gene families. Further, we find evidence for venom gland-specific transcription factor activity and characterize a complement of mechanisms underlying venom production and regulation.

In recent years, there has been increased interest in exploring the genetic mechanisms underlying convergent evolution, in part, owing to the advent of genomic techniques. However, the current ‘genomics gold rush’ in studies of convergence has overshadowed the reality that most trait classifications are quite broadly defined, resulting in incomplete or potentially biased interpretations of results. Genomic studies of convergence would be greatly improved by integrating deep ‘vertical’, natural history knowledge with ‘horizontal’ knowledge focusing on the breadth of taxonomic diversity. Natural history collections have and continue to be best positioned for increasing our comprehensive understanding of phenotypic diversity, with modern practices of digitization and databasing of morphological traits providing exciting improvements in our ability to evaluate the degree of morphological convergence. Combining more detailed phenotypic data with the well-established field of genomics will enable scientists to make progress on an important goal in biology: to understand the degree to which genetic or molecular convergence is associated with phenotypic convergence. Although the fields of comparative biology or comparative genomics alone can separately reveal important insights into convergent evolution, here we suggest that the synergistic and complementary roles of natural history collection-derived phenomic data and comparative genomics methods can be particularly powerful in together elucidating the genomic basis of convergent evolution among higher taxa.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Convergent evolution in the genomics era: new insights and directions’.","2019-07-22","2019-06-21 03:09:48","2019-06-21 03:12:50","2019-06-21 03:09:48","20180248","","1777","374","","Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","royalsocietypublishing-org.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu (Atypon)","","","","/Users/darencard/Cloud_Drives/Box_Sync/Zotero_library/LamichhaneySL_2019_Philosophical_Transactions_of_the_Royal_Society_B_Biological_Sciences_Integrating_natural_history_collections_and_comparative_genomics_to_study_the_genetic_architecture_of_convergent_evolution.pdf; /Users/darencard/Zotero/storage/CDX6QGWU/rstb.2018.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While fasting, these snakes downregulate intestinal form and function, and upon feeding restore intestinal structure and function through major increases in cell growth and proliferation, metabolism and upregulation of digestive function. Previous studies have identified changes in gene expression that underlie this regenerative growth of the python intestine, but the unique features that differentiate this extreme regenerative growth from non-regenerative post-feeding responses exhibited by snakes that feed more frequently remain unclear. Here, we leveraged variation in regenerative capacity across three snake species—two distantly related lineages (Crotalus and Python) that experience regenerative growth, and one (Nerodia) that does not—to infer molecular mechanisms underlying intestinal regeneration using transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. Using a comparative approach, we identify a suite of growth, stress response and DNA damage response signalling pathways with inferred activity specifically in regenerating species, and propose a hypothesis model of interactivity between these pathways that may drive regenerative intestinal growth in snakes.","2019-07-10","2019-08-04 21:30:50","2019-08-04 21:32:49","2019-08-04 21:30:50","20190910","","1906","286","","Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","royalsocietypublishing-org.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu (Atypon)","","","","/Users/darencard/Cloud_Drives/Box_Sync/Zotero_library/PerryBP_2019_Proceedings_of_the_Royal_Society_B_Biological_Sciences_Multi-species_comparisons_of_snakes_identify_coordinated_signalling_networks_underlying_post-feeding_intestinal_regeneration.pdf; /Users/darencard/Zotero/storage/2SSZX6HC/rspb.2019.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chameleons possess body plans that are highly adapted to an arboreal life style, featuring laterally compressed bodies, split hands/ft for grasping, a projectile tongue, turreted independently moving eyes, and a prehensile tail. Despite being one of the most phenotypically divergent clades of tetrapods, genomic resources for chameleons are severely lacking. Methods To address this lack of resources, we used RNAseq to generate 288 million raw Illumina sequence reads from four adult tissues (male and female eyes and gonads) and whole embryos at three distinct developmental stages. We used these data to assemble a largely complete de novo transcriptome consisting of only 82 952 transcripts. In addition, a majority of assembled transcripts (67%) were successfully annotated. Results We then demonstrated the utility of these data in the context of studying visual system evolution by examining the content of veiled chameleon opsin genes to show that chameleons possess all five ancestral tetrapod opsins. Conclusion We present this de novo, annotated, multi-tissue transcriptome assembly for the Veiled Chameleon, Chamaeleo calyptratus, as a resource to address a range of evolutionary and developmental questions.
